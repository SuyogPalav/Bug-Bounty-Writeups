Edmodo platform is one of the largest and most active learning community platforms in the world with over 100 millions+ registered users.

The Story begins here...

After Reporting CORS Exploitation, i stopped my hunting on the Edmodo platform.

After about a month and a half, when i was scrolling up and down my info.txt file on my laptop.
I clicked on the link that I saved:

https://api.edmodo.com/profiles/user_id?param1=&param2=&access_token=eyJ0eXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.eyJpYXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.70VwMabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

The link opened and my account details were displayed.
This means that the `access_token` was still alive.

So, before i do anything, i changed my user_id to another user_id.

and BOOM..!!

Now, i able to see private information of another/all users of Edmodo Account.
(like: email address, home address, city, zip code, state, country, latitude, longitude, created date, role, about, etc.. etcâ€¦)

After performing IDOR, I came across this JWT token,

Edmodo API uses this JWT for authentication purposes.

![understanding of JWT working on Edmodo API - Access token as a parameter](https://i.imgur.com/QMWejZB.jpg "understanding of JWT working on Edmodo API - Access token as a parameter")

JWT token consist of three parts separated by dots :

`[Header.Payload.Signature]` = `access_token=eyJ0eXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(.)eyJpYXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(.)70VwMabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

After decoding this, Payload part claims the expiration time is 24h. `"expires_in": 86400`

But, since i used this token after a month and a half, it was still alive.

**Impact :** So if this token is compromised from users account, attackers will able to see their personal data for a long time (even after IDOR issue is resolved)
