Year ago, I discovered the CORS and IDOR vulnerability on edmodo. 

**Read Here:** [CORS] + [IDOR]

So, before i look something on Edmodo, I thought, letâ€™s go and visit that Endpoint again.

There you can update your information in two ways,
- Either you enter manually, or
- Simply enter a name or city or state or country or zip code and then the application will locate the address you want.

So i started updating the information manually, [intercepted all requests and got that url].

but this time, the endpoint was not showing the credentials of my account.

I checked all request one by one...

In the response of one request, i got lot's of HATEOAS(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) [[1]](https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/) - [[2]](https://spring.io/understanding/HATEOAS) links.

Out of these links, one link was talking about my credentials : `https://api.edmodo.com/schools/My_school_id`

So, what next...

i changed `My_school_id` to `SomeoneElse_school_id`.

and the credentials contains user Phone Number, lat-long, student/teachers school address, role, about, Credentials of other connected teachers/students (their phone number n all...), etc..

I aware about that, Edmodo is vulnerable to CORS,
So in the meantime, I asked them why they do not patch the CORS issueâ€¦???
