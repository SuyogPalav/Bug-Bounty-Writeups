# 🔰 Overview & Bypass of Account Takeover and Privilege Escalation

###### *Account Takeover | Privilege Escalation | Bypass of ATO + PE*

> Account Takeover : `ATO`
> 
> Privilege Escalation : `PE`


## Application Works :

> ```
> - Organization-1 ➔ Boss-A [Owner level action - (create/read/write/delete employee projects + data) + (account_modify/delete employee)] ➜ added employee via link ➜ employee 1, employee 2, ..., employee n
> - Organization-2 ➔ Boss-B [Owner level action - (create/read/write/delete employee projects + data) + (account_modify/delete employee)] ➜ added employee via link ➜ employee 1, employee 2, ..., employee n
> .
> .
> .
> - Organization-n ➔ Boss-n [Owner level action - (create/read/write/delete employee projects + data) + (account_modify/delete employee)] ➜ added employee via link ➜ employee 1, employee 2, ..., employee n
> ```


## Vulnerable Application Flow :

### Before Fixes - ATO flow look like this:

> ```
> - Organization-1 ➔ Boss-A (Attacker) ➜ added Boss-B/n (Victim) of Organization-2/n  via link *Privilege Escalation*✔️ + *Privilege based Action*✔️ ➜ auto added all Employees of Boss-B/n *Information Disclosure*✔️ = *ATO*✔️
> ```

**In above, (assume: Boss as an Admin, Employee as an User)**

- Boss-A added Boss-B into his Organization. (which was not allowed feature) - `[i.e. Privilege Escalation]`.

- Boss-A allows to take Privilege based Action on Boss-B. (if, there is no such feature/s provided for 'Boss to Boss' level interaction, then how will a Boss take an action on another Boss?)

- Because now, Boss-B is an Employee of Boss-A.

- So, the features provided for an employee, will now also apply to Boss-B.

- One major feature is Projects based, Boss-A handles it's own and employees projects. (project permissions : create/read/write/delete). and now, Boss-A is able to handle Boss-B projects.

- Second major feature of this category of employee is “set a new password”.

- Which cause this `PE` based action leads to `ATO`.


## Bypass - Account Takeover + Privilege Escalation

### After Fixes - Application flow look like this:

> ```
> - Organization-1 ➔ Boss-A (Attacker) ➜ added Boss-B/n (Victim) of Organization-2/n  via link *Privilege Escalation*✔️ - *restriction on Privilege based Action*⚠️ ➜ Boss-B/n *Information Disclosure*✔️ = *NO ATO*⚠️
> ```

**In above, (assume: Boss as an Admin, Employee as an User)**

- Based on the application or maybe  it will be an upcoming feature, the company left this PE as it is.
- *[I found a blog on this particular topic, that in the future maybe they will implement boss to boss(/co-boss) communication/facilities between two/multiple organizations…! So they might have implemented it in a test environment first.]*
- After patched (project based feature completely removed) and developer implemented restriction on privileged based action. this means -> `NO PE`, `NO ATO`. [actually, `NO PE based ACTION, NO ATO`]
- *[The Boss-B is still an Employee but the feature provided for it, is now hidden/restricted].*
- Now the situation is, even though it is PE but now it’s a part of a company feature. Therefore need to find one major or/and chain based PE Actions.

> **Note/Tip (as per the behavior) :**
>
> Adding a high-privileged person into the low-privileged person list using Privilege Escalation.
> 
> But then, no permission to take Privilege based Action. It's like a Half Bite.
> 
> If possible, then have to lookout for Full Bite for more impact.


- The Employee has 3 categories in the Organization with all their different features and their handling processes, but one common and important feature was related to password.

- If employee is in,
  - 1st cat: Boss has the authority to set a new password for the employee. (employee can’t create it)
  - 2nd cat: Boss has the authority to create auto/system generated passwords. (boss and employee can’t set it)
  - 3rd cat: Boss has no authority. (employee have their own personal password)

- In the first ATO, Boss-B used to fall in the first category (by default).
- But now that area is restricted.
- `(Boss-B has his own personal password, and now he fell into the employee cat. – 1st is restricted, 3rd will not helpful)`
- So, the Boss-A is having the 2nd cat. option and then he can login to the Boss-B account.
- What about the Boss-B email address? hey, information disclosure is also in this process.

### Bypassed ATO flow, look like this:

> ```
> - Organization-1 ➔ Boss-A (Attacker) ➜ added Boss-B/n (Victim) of Organization-2/n  via link *Privilege Escalation*✔️ ➜ Create a 2nd cat. Employees Section ➜ move Boss-B/n to the 2nd cat.✔️ ➜ Create system generated password for Boss-B/n *Privilege based Action*✔️ ➜ Fetch personal details via *mis-configured API*✔️ ➜ grab Email Address of Boss-B/n *Information Disclosure*✔️ = *ATO*✔️
> ```
